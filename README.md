# SmartMirror
by Gary Chew and Kyle Stadelmann
## Project Overview
We will create a “smart mirror” that functions as a regular reflective mirror, but also displays extra information/applications on its surface. Many of these applications, such as weather, time, and google calendar, have already been built and will be incorporated into our project. We will also build a new module, a 1-second-a-day module that builds a collage of videos from 1-second snapshots recorded by the mirror every day.

## Project Approach
We will create our smart mirror using a 2-way mirror, a LCD monitor, a Raspberry Pi 3, and a webcam. The Raspberry Pi will include the MagicMirror2 software with existing modules for weather, time, alarms, stock, calendar, and to-do list. We will also create our own “1 Second a Day” module.
